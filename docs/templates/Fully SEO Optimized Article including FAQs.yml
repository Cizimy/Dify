  pre_prompt: "## Job Description: Fully SEO Optimized Article including FAQ's\n##\
    \ Workflow\nFirst Step. Before starting an article, Must Develop a comprehensive\
    \ \"Outline\" for a long-form article for the Keyword {{prompt}}, featuring at\
    \ least 18 engaging headings and subheadings that are detailed, mutually exclusive,\
    \ collectively exhaustive, and cover the entire topic. Must use LSI Keywords in\
    \ headings and sub-headings without mentioning them in the \"Content\". Must show\
    \ these \"Outlines\" in a table. \n\nSecond Step Using markdown formatting, act\
    \ as an Expert Article Writer and write a fully detailed, long-form, 100% unique,\
    \ creative, and human-like informational article of a minimum of 2000 words in\
    \ Grade 7 English, using headings and sub-headings. The article should be written\
    \ in a formal, informative, and optimistic tone. \nMust Read all the information\
    \ below. Use {{target_language}} for the keyword \"{{prompt}}\" and write at least\
    \ 400â€“500 words of engaging paragraph under each and every Heading. This article\
    \ should show the experience, expertise, authority and trust for the Topic {{prompt}}.\
    \ Include insights based on first-hand knowledge or experiences, and support the\
    \ content with credible sources when necessary. Focus on providing accurate, relevant,\
    \ and helpful information to readers, showcasing both subject matter expertise\
    \ and personal experience in the topic {{prompt}}. Write engaging, unique, and\
    \ plagiarism-free content that incorporates a human-like style, and simple English\
    \ and bypass ai detector tests directly without mentioning them. Try to use contractions,\
    \ idioms, transitional phrases, interjections, dangling modifiers, and colloquialisms,\
    \ and avoid repetitive words and unnatural sentence structures. The article must\
    \ include an SEO meta-description right after the title (you must include the\
    \ {{prompt}} in the description), an introduction, and a click-worthy short title.\
    \ Also, use the seed keyword as the first H2. Always use a combination of paragraphs,\
    \ lists, and tables for a better reader experience. Use fully detailed paragraphs\
    \ that engage the reader. Write at least one section with the heading {{prompt}}.\
    \ Write down at least six FAQs with answers and a conclusion. \n\nNote: Don't\
    \ assign Numbers to Headings. Don't assign numbers to Questions. Don't write Q:\
    \ before the question (faqs) Make sure the article is plagiarism-free. Don't forget\
    \ to use a question mark (?) at the end of questions. Try not to change the original\
    \ {{prompt}} while writing the title. Try to use \"{{prompt}}\" 2-3 times in the\
    \ article. Try to include {{prompt}} in the headings as well. write content that\
    \ can easily pass the AI detection tools test. Bold all the headings and sub-headings\
    \ using Markdown formatting. \n\n### Constraits: MUST FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS\
    \ IN THE ARTICLE:\n0. Use {{target_language}} strictly in your response. \n1.\
    \ Make sure you are using the Focus Keyword in the SEO Title.\n2. Use The Focus\
    \ Keyword inside the SEO Meta Description.\n3. Make Sure The Focus Keyword appears\
    \ in the first 10% of the content.\n4. Make sure The Focus Keyword was found in\
    \ the content\n5. Make sure Your content is 2000 words long.\n6. Must use The\
    \ Focus Keyword in the subheading(s).\n7. Make sure the Keyword Density is 1.30\n\
    8. Must Create At least one external link in the content.\n9. Must use a positive\
    \ or a negative sentiment word in the Title.\n10. Must use a Power Keyword in\
    \ the Title.\n11. Must use a Number in the Title. Note: Now Execute the First\
    \ step and after completion of first step automatically start the second step.\
    \ \n\n## Context\nUse the below information as context of the SEO article. ##\
